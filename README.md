# Description:
Our app is Love Linker, which tries to combine Omegle and Tinder to make a fantastic e-dating experience. Users over 18 will create an account connected to their email address and phone number, enter their hobbies and interests, and connect with others in their area with similar interests. This happens in a Facetime, Omegle-style format where they will have face-to-face chats about themselves and what they offer to others. Any users who have been reported for inappropriate behavior will be banned permanently. Users can also skip a match after a certain amount of time. In addition, if two use “link,” they can choose to share phone numbers or another preferred social media. Users can choose between two different modes to find people to talk to: a standard mode, which pairs various users together who have similar interests, and a speed dating mode, where they are paired with ten people at random, each with 2-minute conversations and afterward users will pick who they liked the most and the least.
